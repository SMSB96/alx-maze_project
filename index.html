      <p>In the ALX software engineering program, I worked on a project that focused on turning a 2D game map into a 3D view using raycasting. Raycasting is a technique from the 1990s that creates 3D perspectives from 2D maps. This project helped me learn programming basics and algorithms. I used C and the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library to handle graphics and user inputs like keyboards and mice.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4">APPROACH</h2>
      <p>Working on the Maze project was a solo endeavor, allowing me to deeply engage in all aspects of development. I began by thoroughly understanding the concepts of raycasting and its implementation using SDL. I took responsibility for various components, including map generation, raycasting algorithm implementation, user input handling, and rendering optimization.

Regular self-assessment and refining my code ensured alignment and coherence throughout the development process. The maze project operates by projecting a 2D game map onto a 3D perspective using raycasting, a rendering technique that calculates the intersection of rays cast from the player's viewpoint with the walls of the maze. This creates the illusion of depth and allows for dynamic movement within the virtual environment.

The primary programming language used was C, chosen for its efficiency and suitability for low-level manipulation required by the raycasting algorithm. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of programming concepts and algorithms, while also gaining valuable experience in project management and independent problem-solving.
