      <h2 class="mb-4">The Maze</h2>
      <p>In the ALX software engineering program, we worked on a project
aimed at projecting a 2D game map in 3D using a technique called
raycasting. Raycasting is a rendering technique that creates a 3D
perspective from a 2D map and was commonly used in the 90s when
computers were slow and game engines were not very advanced.
This project helped us understand programming concepts and
algorithms. We used the C programming language and the Simple
DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library to manage graphics as well as
keyboard and mouse input interactions.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4">APPROACH</h2>
      <p>Working alongside a peer on The Maze project fostered a collaborative environment where we leveraged our strengths to tackle various aspects of development effectively.

        We began by thoroughly understanding the concepts of raycasting and its implementation using SDL. Dividing the workload, we each took responsibility for specific components, such as map generation, raycasting algorithm implementation, user input handling, and rendering optimization.
        
        Regular communication and code reviews ensured alignment and coherence throughout the development process. The maze project operates by projecting a 2D game map onto a 3D perspective using raycasting, a rendering technique that calculates the intersection of rays cast from the player's viewpoint with the walls of the maze. This creates the illusion of depth and allows for dynamic movement within the virtual environment.
        
        The primary programming language used was C, chosen for its efficiency and suitability for low-level manipulation required by the raycasting algorithm. Through this collaboration, we not only deepened our understanding of programming concepts and algorithms but also honed our teamwork and communication skills, laying a solid foundation for future projects.</p>
